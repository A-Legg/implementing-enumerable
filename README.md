# Implmenting Enumerable

Something is wrong with Ruby! The Enumerable methods that we know and love have
stopped working (not really, but let's pretend).

Let's implement some of our favorite Enumerable methods without using any of
the built it methods that Ruby gives us. We will add `g_` to the methods names
to make sure that we don't interfere with Ruby's built in methods.

## Enumerable

- g_each
- g_select
- g_reject
- g_map
- g_find
- g_select!
